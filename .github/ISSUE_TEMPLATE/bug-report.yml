        What should we do to reproduce the problem?
      placeholder: >
        Please make sure you provide a reproducible step-by-step case of how to reproduce the problem,
        including the exact command(s) you ran as well as the `.sql` file.
        as minimally and precisely as possible. Keep in mind we do not have access to your deployment.
        If the issue requires more than two files (i.e. `.sql` file and `.sqlfluff` files) to reproduce, please
        consider providing a GitHub repo instead. Unfortunately non-reproducible issues will have to be closed.
