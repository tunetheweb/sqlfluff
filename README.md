**SQLFluff** is a dialect-flexible and configurable SQL linter. Designed with ELT applications in mind, **SQLFluff** also works with Jinja templating and dbt. **SQLFluff** will auto-fix most linting errors, allowing you to focus your time on what matters.

## Dialects Supported

Although SQL is reasonably consistent in its implementations, there are several different dialects available with variations of syntax and grammar. **SQLFluff** currently supports the following SQL dialects (though perhaps not in full):

- ANSI SQL - this is the base version and on occasion may not strictly follow the ANSI/ISO SQL definition
- [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)
- [Db2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/db2)
- [Exasol](https://www.exasol.com/)
- [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/index.html)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (aka Postgres)
- [Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/index.html)
- [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)
- [SOQL](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm)
- [SparkSQL](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
- [Teradata](https://www.teradata.com/)
- [Transact-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-reference) (aka T-SQL)

We aim to make it easy to expand on the support of these dialects and also add other, currently unsupported, dialects. Please [raise issues](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues) (or upvote any existing issues) to let us know of demand for missing support.

Pull requests from those that know the missing syntax or dialects are especially welcomed and are the question way for you to get support added. We are happy to work with any potential contributors on this to help them add this support. Please raise an issue first for any large feature change to ensure it is a good fit for this project before spending time on this work.

## Templates Supported

SQL itself does not lend itself well to [modularity](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/viewpoint#section-modularity), so to introduce some flexibility and reusability it is often [templated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor) as discussed more in [our modularity documentation](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/realworld.html#modularity).

**SQLFluff** supports the following templates:
- [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) (aka Jinja2)
- [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)

Again, please raise issues if you wish to support more templating languages/syntaxes.

# Getting Started

To get started, install the package and run `sqlfluff lint` or `sqlfluff fix`.

```shell
$ pip install sqlfluff
$ echo "  SELECT a  +  b FROM tbl;  " > test.sql
$ sqlfluff lint test.sql --dialect ansi
== [test.sql] FAIL
L:   1 | P:   1 | L050 | Files must not begin with newlines or whitespace.
L:   1 | P:   3 | L003 | First line has unexpected indent
L:   1 | P:  11 | L039 | Unnecessary whitespace found.
L:   1 | P:  14 | L039 | Unnecessary whitespace found.
L:   1 | P:  27 | L001 | Unnecessary trailing whitespace.
```

Alternatively, you can use the [**Official SQLFluff Docker Image**](https://hub.docker.com/r/sqlfluff/sqlfluff) or have a play using [**SQLFluff online**](https://online.sqlfluff.com/).
