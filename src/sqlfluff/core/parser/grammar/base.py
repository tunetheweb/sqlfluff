            at (:obj:`int`, optional): The position in the elements
                to insert the item. Defaults to `None` which means
                insert at the end of the elements.
            before (optional): An alternative to _at_ to determine the
                position of an insertion. Using this inserts the elements
                immediately before the position of this element.
                Note that this is not an _index_ but an element to look
                for (i.e. a Segment or Grammar which will be compared
                with other elements for equality).
            remove (:obj:`list`, optional): A list of individual
                elements to remove from a grammar. Removal is done
                *after* insertion so that order is preserved.
                Elements are searched for individually.
