    """Block a list of configurable words from being used.

    This generic rule can be useful to prevent certain keywords, functions, or objects
    from being used. Only whole words can be blocked, not phrases, nor parts of words.

    This block list is case insensitive.

    **Example use cases**

    * We prefer ``BOOL`` over ``BOOLEAN`` and there is no existing rule to enforce
      this. Until such a rule is written, we can add ``BOOLEAN`` to the deny list
      to cause a linting error to flag this.
    * We have deprecated a schema/table/function and want to prevent it being used
      in future. We can add that to the denylist and then add a ``-- noqa: L062`` for
      the few exceptions that still need to be in the code base for now.

    **Anti-pattern**

    If the ``blocked_words`` config is set to ``deprecated_table,bool`` then the
    following will flag:

    .. code-block:: sql

        SELECT * FROM deprecated_table WHERE 1 = 1;
        CREATE TABLE myschema.t1 (a BOOL);

    **Best practice**

    Do not used any blocked words:

    .. code-block:: sql

        SELECT * FROM another_table WHERE 1 = 1;
        CREATE TABLE myschema.t1 (a BOOLEAN);
