Production Usage
================

SQLFluff is designed to be used both as a utility for developers but also to
be part of `CI/CD`_ pipelines.

Using SQLFluff on a whole sql codebase
--------------------------------------

The `exit code`_ provided by SQLFluff when run as a command line utility is
designed to assist usefulness in deployment pipelines. If no violations
are found then the `exit code`_ will be 0. If violations are found then
a non-zero code will be returned which can be interrogated to find out
more.

- At the moment all error states related to linting return *65*.
- An error as a result of a SQLFluff internal error will return *1*.

Using SQLFluff on changes using `diff-quality`
----------------------------------------------

For projects with large amounts of (potentially imperfect) SQL code, the full
SQLFluff output could be very large, which can be distracting -- perhaps the CI
build for a one-line SQL change shouldn't encourage the developer to fix lots
of unrelated quality issues.

To support this use case, SQLFluff integrates with a quality checking tool
called `diff-quality`. By running SQLFluff using `diff-quality` (rather than
running it directly), you can limit the the output to the new or modified SQL
in the branch (aka pull request or PR) containing the proposed changes.

Currently, ``diff-quality`` requires that you are using ``git`` for version
control.

NOTE: Installing SQLFluff automatically installs the `diff_cover` package that
provides the `diff-quality` tool.

Adding `diff-quality` to your builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In your CI build script:

1. Set the current working directory to the ``git`` repository containing the
SQL code to be checked.

2. Run `diff-quality`, specifying SQLFluff as the underlying tool:

.. code-block:: text

    $ diff-quality --violations sqlfluff

The output will look something like:

.. code-block:: text

    -------------
    Diff Quality
    Quality Report: sqlfluff
    Diff: origin/master...HEAD, staged and unstaged changes
    -------------
    sql/audience_size_queries/constraints/_postcondition_check_gdpr_compliance.sql (0.0%):
    sql/audience_size_queries/constraints/_postcondition_check_gdpr_compliance.sql:5: Unquoted Identifiers must be consistently upper case.
    -------------
    Total:   1 line
    Violations: 1 line
    % Quality: 0%
    -------------

These messages are basically the same as those provided directly by SQLFluff,
although the format is a little different. Note that `diff-quality` only lists
the line _numbers_, not the character position. If you need the character
position, you will need to run SQLFluff directly.

For more information on `diff-quality`, see the
`documentation <https://diff-cover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. It covers topics
such as:

* Generating HTML reports
* Controlling which branch to compare against (i.e. to determine new/changed
  lines). The default is `origin/master`.
* Configuring `diff-quality` to return an error code if the quality is too low
* Troubleshooting

Using `pre-commit`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`pre-commit`_ is a framework to manage git "hooks"
triggered right before a commit is made.

A `git hook`_ is a git feature to "fire off custom scripts"
when specific actions occur.

Using `pre-commit`_ with SQLFluff is a good way
to provide automated linting to SQL developers.

With `pre-commit`_, you also get the benefit of
only linting/fixing the files that changed.

SQLFluff comes with two `pre-commit`_ hooks:

* sqlfluff-lint: returns linting errors.
* sqlfluff-fix: attempts to fix rule violations.

.. warning::
   For safety reasons, ``sqlfluff-fix`` by default will not make any fixes in
   files that had templating or parse errors, even if those errors were ignored
   using ``noqa`` or `--ignore``.

   Although it is not advised, you *can* tell SQLFluff to try and fix
   these files by overriding the ``fix_even_unparsable`` setting
   in ``.sqlfluff`` config file or using the ``sqlfluff fix --FIX-EVEN-UNPARSABLE``
   command line option.

   *Overriding this behavior may break your SQL. If you use this override,
   always be sure to review any fixes applied to files with templating or parse
   errors to verify they are okay.*

You should create a file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
at the root of your git project, which should look
like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

  repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff
    rev: |release|
    hooks:
      - id: sqlfluff-lint
        # For dbt projects, this installs the dbt "extras".
        # You will need to select the relevant dbt adapter for your dialect
        # (https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/available-adapters):
        # additional_dependencies: ['<dbt-adapter>', 'sqlfluff-templater-dbt']
      - id: sqlfluff-fix
        # Arbitrary arguments to show an example
        # args: [--rules, "L003,L014"]
        # additional_dependencies: ['<dbt-adapter>', 'sqlfluff-templater-dbt']

When trying to use the `dbt templater`_, uncomment the
``additional_dependencies`` to install the extras.
This is equivalent to running ``pip install <dbt-adapter> sqlfluff-templater-dbt``.

You can specify the verion of ``dbt-adapter`` used in `pre-commit`_,
for example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   additional_dependencies : ['dbt-bigquery==1.0.0', 'sqlfluff-templater-dbt']

See the list of available `dbt-adapters`_.

Note that you can pass the same arguments available
through the CLI using ``args:``.

Using `GitHub Actions`_ to Annotate PRs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are two way to utilize SQLFluff to annotate Github PRs.

1. When `sqlfluff lint` is run with the `--format github-annotation-native`
   option, it produces output formatted as `Github workflow commands`_ which
   are converted into pull request annotations by Github.

2. When `sqlfluff lint` is run with the `--format github-annotation` option, it
   produces output compatible with this `action <https://github.com/yuzutech/annotations-action>`_.
   Which uses Github API to annotate the SQL in `GitHub pull requests`.

For more information and examples on using SQLFluff in GitHub Actions, see the
`sqlfluff-github-actions repository <https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff-github-actions>`_.
